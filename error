I'm not sure what happened then, 
but in case someone else runs into this problem here is what i did to get it working. 
Install the watir-classic (as suggested), install ffi, uninstall ffi, install ffi again. 
For some reason i had 2 variations of ffi (might be due to originally installing Ruby 64 bit?), 
but I also uninstalled 64 bit Ruby and installed 32 bit to get this all working.
